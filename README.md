# FFT-implementation-in-RISCV-using-PCPI
The objective of this project is to design and implement an FFT co-processor for picorv32 using the PCPI interface. The co-processor will be able to perform FFT on 16-point complex input sequences and output the corresponding frequency spectra. The co-processor will be synthesized and tested on a Xilinx Vivado FPGA board.
